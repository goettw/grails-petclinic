Grails Pet Clinic application
=============================

This is a Grails port of the standard Spring Pet Clinic web application. It's very simple, consisting of a few domain classes for persistence and three controllers to support the user interface.

The application uses the [Cloud Foundry Grails plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/cloud-foundry) to discover the database service bound to the application when pushed to Cloud Foundry, as described in the [Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/services/grails-service-bindings.html). 

### The domain model

This is the basic domain model for the Pet Clinic application:

               Person               Clinic
              /      \
          Owner      Vet
            |         |
           Pet    Speciality
          /   \
    PetType  Visit

An `Owner` has many `Pet`s, which in turn has many `Visit`s and a `PetType`. A `Vet` has many `Speciality`s. `Clinic` is on its own, but has a controller dedicated to it.

## Building and running locally

To build and run this application, use the following command:

    $ ./grailsw run-app

This will start the application in development mode and use an in-memory HSQLDB database.

*Note:* The first time the `./grailsw` command is run, it will take a while to download the Grails framework. Subsequent Grails commands will run much faster.

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

To run the application on Cloud Foundry, first build the project into a .war file:

    $ ./grailsw prod war

After installing the 'cf' [command-line interface for Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/),
targeting a Cloud Foundry instance, and logging in, the application can be pushed using these commands:

    $ cf push

When using the provided `manifest.yml` file, MySQL service will not be created but bound to the app when it is pushed. A service called petdb has to be available.ZZ
